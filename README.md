A simple benchmarking tool to run your GraphQL queries against your GraphQL backend and get a preliminary sense of its  performance characteristics. 

We built this benchmarking suite to benchmark different GraphQL data backends. The database used is a [Postgres variant](https://github.com/xivSolutions/ChinookDb_Pg_Modified/tree/pg_names) of [Chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database). The benchmarking tool used is [wrk2](https://github.com/giltene/wrk2), a derivative of [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk).

You can easily add your own GraphQL backend and your own GraphQL queries and run your benchmark.

## Running benchmarks

You'll need to have `docker` and `curl` to perform these benchmarks

1. Clone the repo.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hasura/graphql-bench.git && cd graphql-bench
   ```

2. Build the tooling
   ```bash
   docker build --no-cache -t "hasura/graphql-bench:0.2" "$(pwd)/tooling"
   ```

3. Setup the graphql servers that you are interested in.
   ```bash
   ./hasura/manage.sh init
   ./prisma/manage.sh init
   ./postgraphile/manage.sh init
   ```

4. Define the queries that you would like to benchmark in `hasura/queries.graphql`, `prisma/queries.graphql`, `postgraphile/queries.graphql`. There are few queries that already exist.

5. Define a benchmark (checkout sample.bench.yaml) say bench.yaml.

6. Run the benchmark
   ```bash
   cat bench.yaml | docker run -i --rm -p 8050:8050 -v $(pwd):/graphql-bench/ws hasura/graphql-bench:0.2
   ```
   or run a benchmark on a sample query
   ```bash
   cat sample.bench.yaml | docker run -i --rm -p 8050:8050 -v $(pwd):/graphql-bench/ws hasura/graphql-bench:0.2 --query artistByArtistId
   ```
   This opens up a http server at http://127.0.0.1:8050 which displays the results of the benchmark.

7. Tear down the setup
   ```bash
   ./hasura/manage.sh nuke
   ./prisma/manage.sh nuke
   ./postgraphile/manage.sh nuke
   ```

## Bench.yaml

This file specifes the benchmarks that need to be run. The file is a list of benchmark specifications where each spec is as follows:
```yaml
  # name of the query in queries.graphql. Should be same across all the candidates
- query: tracks_media_some
  # response timeout
  timeout: 1s
  # the benchmarks are first run for this duration and the results are ignored
  warmup_duration: 60
  # the duration of each benchmark
  duration: 300
  # number of open connections to the server
  open_connections: 20
  # the servers to be benchmarked, their dir and urls
  candidates:
  - dir: hasura
    url: http://172.17.0.1:7080
  - dir: prisma
    url: http://172.17.0.1:4466
  - dir: postgraphile
    url: http://172.17.0.1:5000
  # Requests/sec
  rps:
  - 200
  - 400
  - 600
  - 800
  - 1000
```

By default, when you run
```bash
cat bench.yaml | docker run -i --rm -p 8050:8050 -v $(pwd):/graphql-bench/ws hasura/graphql-bench:0.2
```
all the benchmarks in bench.yaml are run.

You can however run one particular benchmark by specifying the query with ``--query`` argument.
```bash
cat sample.bench.yaml | docker run -i --rm -p 8050:8050 -v $(pwd):/graphql-bench/ws hasura/graphql-bench:0.2 --query artistByArtistId
```

## Sample plot

When the above benchmark is run, the results on an i7-4710HQ CPU, 8GB RAM, SSD machine are as follows:
